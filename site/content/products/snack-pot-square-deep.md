Snack Pot Square Deep. At 108 square and 65mm deep this pot is perfect for a variety of snack food products. See also D607 which is the shallower version at 50mm rather than 65mm deep. These are attractive designed pots that can be range sold due to the different depths - they are stackable and have been designed for a heat seal closure. Products are available to order in Clear or Black Material.

 

Please note: All orders are made to order.
