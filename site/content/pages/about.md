      ## Services

      We manage our customers’ requirements via a series of rigorous standards and processes, all of which add up to great service levels and products that delight. This means we concentrate on efficient stock control - managing demand on JIT (just in time) products by working with you on forward forecasting to plan out our manufacturing, storage and distribution strategies.

      Delyn understands the seasonal nature of our clients’ businesses - we appreciate the challenges these present so we work hard to help you manage these periods of intense demand.

      Delyn adds value through agreed co-packing services. We run a full padding operation for meat trays, we fit ‘sporks’ into salad trays and we label trays where required - dovetailing in with your business needs.


      Please [contact us](/contact) if you have any contract packing requirement and we would be pleased to quote for you.
