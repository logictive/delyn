The beginning of September brought a change of role at Delyn for Chris Fishbourne. Chris who&#8217;s been with the business as an engineer for 5 years has been training on our &#8216;Solidworks&#8217; design programme to enable him to take on the role of design engineer. Chris has now completed all his initial training and we have seen some super new designs for him for several projects. This new role for Chris will allow Delyn to deliver exciting bespoke design ideas for our clients.
