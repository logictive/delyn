Following recent comments in the media regarding plastics, Delyn Packaging have issued the following comment.

Delyn packaging take their environmental commitments very seriously. Plastics allow food manufacturers amongst others, to deliver high quality foods to the consumer, protecting food safety and helping to extend product life and ensure product integrity.
  
All the plastics Delyn use, are fully recyclable. In most cases they are manufactured from a minimum of 55% recycled material with in some cases the recycled content being up to 80%. In addition, 99% of the waste material produced during the manufacturing process is recycled.
  
Delyn will continue to review the most up to date advances in material technology to help deliver these benefits to consumers, industry and to preserve the natural resources of the planet.
  
In common with all of the plastics industry Delyn urge the government to focus upon increasing the availability of recycling schemes to benefit all and reduce the plastics going unnecessarily to landfill.
